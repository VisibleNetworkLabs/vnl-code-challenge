# VNL Code Challenge

## Summary

We have a source tree that has 5 questions ranging in difficulty. The object is to predict the outcome to the best of your ability. 

Question 1 and Question 2 are at the root level and are algorithm oriented. 

Question 3 is an example end point that access your familiarity with a php backend and web protocol. 

Question 4 is a javascript framework assement. 

Question 5 is a combination of the skills assessed in question 3 and 4 that represents a full stack flow and mimics a parred down verion of our code base.

## Rules

We want to assess your ability to problem solve and work through reading code. So we allow any questions or googling that you would normally do to figure out a code problem. Some of the code cannot be run so if you need input or help determining an output we can help talk through it. Again we are not looking for a perfect answer, but are more interested in your expertice. 

For this process to work we will need you to share your whole screen so we can get an idea of what resources you are using. Also for the font end challenges we would like to see a mock up of what the code will produce and the best way to do that is a quick sketch on pen and paper or you can use [sketch.io](sketch.io).
