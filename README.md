# VNL Code Challenge

## Summary

We have a source tree that has 5 questions ranging in difficulty. Your objective is to predict the outcome of each question to the best of your ability. 

Question 1 and Question 2 are at the root level and are algorithm oriented. 

Question 3 is an example endpoint that is meant to assess your familiarity with a PHP backend and web transfer protocols. 

Question 4 is a JavaScript framework asseessment.

Question 5 assesses a combination of the skills assessed in questions 3 and 4 and represents a full stack flow and mimics a pared-down verion of our code base.

## Rules

We want to assess your ability to problem solve and work through reading code. We allow you to ask any questions or to Google anything as you would normally do to figure out a code problem. Some of the code cannot be run, so if you need input or help determining an output we can help talk through it. Again we are not looking for a perfect answer, but are more interested in your expertise. 

For this process to work we will need you to share your whole screen so we can get an idea of what resources you are using. For the frontend challenges we would like to see a mock up of what the code will produce and the best way to do that is a quick sketch on pen and paper or you can use [sketch.io](sketch.io).
